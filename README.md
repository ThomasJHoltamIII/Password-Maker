# Password Generator



## Application


This application generates a password for you. It has a drop-down menu that opens after clicking to generate a password. These options include numbers, symbols, uppercase, and character counts (8â€“128). Depending on your selections, a password will be generated based on them; if not, it defaults to lowercase.

Thomas Holtam. Starter code without functionality was provided, and I added Javascript for function as well as some CSS and HTML to bind elements together and add a dropdown menu.
